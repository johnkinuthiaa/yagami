                Hello there 👋, I am a Software Developer from <strong>Nairobi, Kenya</strong> .
                Currently involved in software development and design engineering,
                I’m passionate about a wide spectrum of topics revolving around science and technology.

                I love creating content and crafting interactive, beautiful — (and sometimes crappy) — websites.
                During my leisure time, you’ll find me watching recreational programming videos by Mr. Tsoding, sharing
                memes on my Insta page, or listening to Prime Agen’s rants.
                When I’m not glued to my computer,
                I enjoy taking long strolls alone, letting my thoughts roam freely and wildly.
