                Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I am a Software Developer from Nairobi, Kenya.
                Currently involved in software development and design engineering,
                Iâ€™m passionate about a wide spectrum of topics revolving around science and technology.

                I love creating content, art, and crafting interactive, beautiful â€” and sometimes crappy â€” websites.
                During my leisure time, youâ€™ll find me watching recreational programming videos by Mr. Tsoding, sharing
                memes on my Insta page, or listening to Prime Agenâ€™s rants.
                When Iâ€™m not glued to my computer,
                I enjoy taking long strolls alone, letting my thoughts roam freely and wildly.
